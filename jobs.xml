                Airbyte is the open-source standard for EL(T). We enable data teams to replicate data from applications, APIs, and databases to data warehouses, lakes, and other destinations. We believe only an open-source approach can solve the problem of data integration, as it enables us to cover the long tail of integrations while enabling teams to adapt pre-built connectors to their needs.
So far, we&apos;ve built over 350 connectors and have had 35,000+ companies replicating data with us. We&apos;ve raised $181M from some of the world&apos;s top investors (Benchmark, Accel, Altimeter, Coatue, Y Combinator, etc.) and believe in product-led growth, where we build something awesome and let our product bring the users, rather than an outbound sales engine with cold calls.
Airbyte is remote friendly, with most of the team still based in Silicon Valley. We�re fully transparent as a company. Our company handbook, core values, methodology, strategy and roadmap are open to all.

                At Divvy Homes, we&apos;re building an on-ramp to homeownership � one that&apos;s more flexible, more affordable, and an all-around better fit for today�s American family � and it�s working. Recognized as Time 100�s most influential companies of 2022 and a Great Place to Work, Divvy strives to build a team that can uphold our mission.
Principal Software Engineer
At Divvy Homes, we&apos;re building an on-ramp to homeownership � one that&apos;s more flexible, more affordable, and an all-around better fit for today�s American family � and it�s working. Recognized as Time 100�s most influential companies of 2022 and a Great Place to Work, Divvy strives to build a team that can uphold our mission.
About This Role
Divvy manages a portfolio of homes that our residents live in. It�s hard enough to manage and maintain one home, but with so many residents depending on us we have to work smarter, not harder. Our thesis at Divvy is that we can enable more efficient portfolio management through the pragmatic use of technology that lets us offer a fundamentally better resident experience. Seems like a fun challenge? We�d love to have you join us!
The Resident Operations Pod builds and maintains a collection of internal tools, interfaces, and automation that help us manage our portfolio and respond to our customer�s needs. We want to delight our residents and our operations partners by creating tools that drive swift resolutions, ideally before something can even become a problem. We work with our operations partners on a daily basis to figure out what they need and do it. These folks are experts in their domains, but they aren�t coders. It�s up to us to translate their asks into things we can implement and to let them know what�s easy and hard for us to do so we can best support them.
Engineering Opportunities
Transparently, the systems we built to serve our first 100 customers have not scaled well. Wide ranging tech debt slows down our engineering teams and the stakeholders that we work with. An exceptional candidate will excel at making pragmatic choices when interfacing with legacy code. Sometimes we should nuke and pave; other times we should do the proverbial brain surgery to carefully disentangle the dataflow; occasionally we should just not do things because the time it would take to do them isn�t worth the benefit. We critically think through the implications of our choices and endeavor to make contextually appropriate decisions with guidance from our operations partners as well as product and design.
We regularly work with our operations partners to figure out what new or different tools they need and then build them. Our partners aren&apos;t technical, but they are smart and passionate. We&apos;re working to bring sound technical and architectural decision making to these problems, and build the tools needed to scale Divvy�s operations into the future.
We care intensely about developing our engineers, and so our teams work to provide support and guidance along everyone�s technical journey, regardless of experience. As a leader, we expect you to support other folks� development whether they are more senior or more junior.
Responsibilities
 Guide the team to develop pragmatic cross-functional decisions to design, build, test, and ship a scalable product  Work across our stack. Our core tools are TypeScript, React, Node, Postgres, and Google Cloud Platform. You don�t need to know these now, but you�ll need to learn to use them.  Talk with stakeholders a lot to figure out what needs to be done  Interface with APIs and external tools as a force multiplier; make good choices for build vs buy  Serve as a trusted leader and resource for all members of the team, other engineering teams, as well as our operations partners  Skills &amp; Experience:
 You think functional programming is fun, you�re passionate about it, and/or you have experience in TypeScript, Scala, Elixir, Lisp, ML, Haskell, or a similar functional language. You accomplish more with less code.  You�ve been writing code for a bit now. This can be personally, volunteer, or professionally. We care that you can make sound choices based on your skills and experience, not the number of years or degrees on your resume.  You see understanding, working with, and improving questionable code as a fun and exciting challenge. We made some choices that haven�t aged well when initially figuring out what our product should be, rapidly scaling it up, and adding new products. We now need to incrementally fix those problems so we can dynamically support new business directions.  You champion users and stakeholders who might not always feel like they have a seat at the table. You make sure to understand the needs of all stakeholders and make pragmatic and technically sound implementation decisions based on this understanding.  Perks &amp; Benefits:
 We have a documented equal pay policy, and do not negotiate on offers.  To maintain fairness and keep starting total comp the same for anyone who comes into that position, individual pay is determined by role, level and work location only. At offer stage, we give candidates 3 different offers to choose from depending on how they want to favor cash vs equity. The US-based salary range for this position is $233,650 to $243,650 + equity + benefits. The range displayed reflects the minimum and maximum new hire salary across all US locations. Your Recruiter will discuss the relevant compensation range during your initial screen.
 100% remote first culture, with an onsite option at our San Francisco or Denver offices  Prioritizes health &amp; wellness with flexible PTO, monthly mental health day, generous leave policies and company-sponsored Modern Health coaching and therapy sessions  Competitive salary + equity  90% paid medical benefits for you and your dependents (medical, dental, vision)  401k match &amp; access to a financial planner  $1,000 professional development stipend  One-time $350 remote workspace allowance  $250 monthly co-working space stipend  16 weeks paid parental leave &amp; flexible return to work  Recognized as Time 100�s most influential companies of 2022 &amp; a Great Place to Work 
Divvy Homes is committed to building a diverse and inclusive team. We are woman-led and have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion from the moment Divvy was founded. Divvy has 8 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to celebrate not only our cultural uniqueness, but also to create a sense of belonging. We care deeply about hiring a workforce that is diverse not only in gender and ethnicity, but in experience, thought, and geography. We enthusiastically encourage individuals from a variety of lived experiences to reach out and learn more about our roles at Divvy.</Description>

                Who We Are...
Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in the United States. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We are a team of physicians (Groups), technologists (Athena, Hudson River Trading) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to the United States� future health. Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, AlleyCorp, and SV Angel.
Pearl Health helps PCPs who are overwhelmed by the demands of an aging population and the unpredictable business model inherent to Traditional Medicare. Over time, this solution will empower PCPs to provide better care to their entire patient population. We believe there is a need to bring humanism back to healthcare by giving physicians the ability to better allocate their time with patients, increasing their autonomy, creating incentives that are aligned with achieving better outcomes through clinical decision-making powered by actionable intelligence, and making risk more available and more readily optimized through an intelligent marketplace. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) is launching a new value-based care program to disrupt Traditional Medicare, and we believe that this represents an opportunity to achieve the meaningful change we envision.

We are a tech-forward, remote native, mutually supportive consulting organization with a culture of:
Continuous learningSolution qualityTeamwork and transparencyIntegrity
We value work-life balance, thoroughness, &amp; bias to action. And we&apos;re growing quickly!

This position is not currently eligible for visa sponsorship.
What&apos;s the job?
You will work collaboratively with other other software engineering consultants at top tier clients (including FAANG companies) innovating interesting solutions. Many of our projects are large scale cloud enterprise integrations that involve writing and altering existing software and programmatic creation of cloud-based resources.
You&apos;ll lead or support engagements where you and other engineers may do things like write Web services, build out infrastructure as code, set up a CI/CD pipeline, develop an observability framework, write a management interface, validate security of cloud assets, connect cloud assets to on premises and remote users, tune automated HPC infrastructure, and similar cloud and DevOps work, all in a programmatic manner!
Our staff engineers are given broad, tough problems and operate autonomously to solve them. They perform high end technical architecture, lead major client engagements, rescue other engineers when they hit the really hard problems, help ensure our high standard of engineering quality, and mentor other engineers.
Our expectation of candidates for staff engineer is that they are skilled, independent technical leaders and executors.
You&apos;ll have the opportunity to drive new lines of business and build out entirely new toolsets to accelerate service implementations of those new use cases.

Who are we looking for?
Candidates with a strong software engineering background with DevOps and cloud experience.
The expectation of this role is to be a catalyst for improvement in both client projects and our internal skills. We have a limited number of staff engineers at the company.

    <Description>About the job
        


        
                At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable and accessible for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation�s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.
Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn&apos;t�and why.
Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies and health plans, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.
YOUR TEAM In Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, an accurate representation of the underlying data, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users&apos; needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.
The Nuna Web Engineering team is Nuna�s full stack application &amp; frontend engineering team. We build Nuna�s user-facing web apps &amp; APIs from the databases to the UIs. We work with the output of Nuna�s Data Platform, turning large datasets into innovative data visualizations, easy-to-understand dashboards, and highly reliable APIs. We are building for the long term with a focus on increasing engineer velocity across Nuna by maintaining a UI components library, an API-in-a-box kit, and standardized development and deployment infrastructure tooling for all of Nuna�s application development. We ensure enterprise-grade stability and startup-grade velocity by maintaining a well-tested code base and infrastructure that is secure-by-default.
YOUR OPPORTUNITIESYou�ll build products that change the dynamics and incentives of the healthcare industry, changing a zero-sum game of competition between payers and providers into patient-centered collaboration.You�ll put data science magic (like predictive analytics and dynamic modeling) into our users� hands through interactive features in collaboration with the Data Engineering &amp; Data Science teams.You�ll design APIs and service architectures that multiply the effectiveness of internal and external developers serving millions of patients.You�ll build innovative and beautiful data visualizations that illuminate the path towards higher quality care at lower cost.You�ll manage our high stakes production environment, ensuring high availability/low latency and protecting our sensitive data with rigorous security.You�ll identify big opportunities to improve our technology and our products, blazing trails through ambiguity.You�ll mentor more junior engineers and, in turn, learn from more senior engineers, because we are learners, not knowers, and growing Nuna�s people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.You�ll work as part of a team, not in a silo. At Nuna we rise by lifting others
QUALIFICATIONSAs a full-stack application engineering team, we need a wide array of skills as a whole. We want UX engineers, backend engineers, full stack engineers, and everything in between. No single engineer needs to cover every single dimension, so don�t take this as a literal requirements checklist. We&apos;re excited to talk with you if you bring some or all of the following:Experience building production-hardened web services, with consideration for security, performance, scalability, reliability, and repeatability. Familiarity with application server frameworks like DjangoExperience sustainably engineering Javascript applications, ideally with React and TypescriptExperience with API design and service-oriented system architectureExperience rapidly prototyping new product concepts, especially for enterprise clients.Understanding of automated testing concepts in web apps and the ability to consistently apply themKnowledge of database fundamentals like indexing, SQL queries, schema migrations, and managing backupsExperience managing production services and designing smooth deployment processes, ideally in AWS
TECHNOLOGIES USED AT NUNAPython, Django, SQL, testing tools (e.g. pytest)JavaScript, TypeScript, React, module bundlers (e.g. Webpack), testing tools (e.g. Cypress, Jest), CSS, HTMLLinux, OS XAWS ECS, RDS, Security Groups, IAM, Lambda; Hashicorp Terraform and Vault
We take into account an individual�s qualifications, skillset, and experience in determining final salary. This role is eligible for health insurance, life insurance, retirement benefits, participation in the company�s equity program, paid time off, including vacation and sick leave. The expected salary range for this position is $165,000 to $230,000. The actual offer will be at the company�s sole discretion and determined by relevant business considerations, including the final candidate�s qualifications, years of experience, and skillset.

    <Description>About the job
        


        
                The Developer Platform team is nimble, innovative, and rapidly growing as it creates the foundational building blocks leveraged by every data scientist and software engineer at Included Health. We understand and anticipate the needs of developers working in a service oriented architecture, which allows us to maximize our impact with cross-cutting features. The Developer Platform team comprises two focus areas: Developer Experience and Identity and Access Management (IAM). Currently, these two groups are focused on simplifying operation/rapid creation of microservices and rebuilding our IAM platform respectively.
The Developer Platform team is part of the greater Infrastructure organization with a shared mission to drive engineering velocity. Infrastructure engineers are impactful, high-leverage force-multipliers; we thrive by causally improving the effectiveness of the entire engineering organization. We work directly with our stakeholders, exercising the right amount of empathy to help define and scope our projects. If you believe that self-organizing, highly autonomous teams build better platforms, then this is the right opportunity for you. We are not an operations team.
We are agile and iterative in nature and consistently optimize for impact. We recognize that we may not get technology, tooling, or processes right on our first try and thus believe shipping value incrementally and learning is the best way to maximize our impact. We are looking for smart, self-motivated software engineers at all levels to join our truly exceptional development team.
